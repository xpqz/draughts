# Draughts game in Golang

This was the task set at the Bristol Schools' Code Jam 2017 competition where
I was part of the judging panel.

Implement the game of Draughts (English Checkers) as a two-player game. It
should:

1. Create the initial board state
1. Allow players to take alternate turns, and display the new board state
1. Verify that moves are legal
1. Determine if there is a winner
1. Implement capture moves
1. Implement king transitions

A pretty complex task given the 2.5 hours of coding time available. Teams could
pick any programming language they wanted, and part of the task was to produce
an initial plan or design for the solution.

Teams were using Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, VisualBasic and even Unity.
Whilst no team demonstrably got beyond the first three points above, we saw
some good skills and innovative solutions.

This is my solution that I sketched out during the competition and now fleshed
out to serve as an illustration to how it could be done.
